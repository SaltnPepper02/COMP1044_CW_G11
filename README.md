# How to run our website?
Our website is not hosted on a live service such as UNMC Mercury but it can be run on a locally hosted server using XAMPP. 

### Steps
1. Start the Apache and MySQL modules from the XAMPP Control Panel.
2. Go to http://localhost/phpmyadmin/ and import the database with the file labelled `cw2_library.sql`. It will look as shown below:

3. After the database has been uploaded, you can start testing out the website by going to http://localhost/CW2/LMSLogin.html

### Video demonstrating Website Interface
If for some reason you are unable to test out the website, do contact me. But if you are just curious, you can see the video below to see how it is intended to work:
